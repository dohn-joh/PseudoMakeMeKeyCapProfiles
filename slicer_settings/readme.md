FDM printing: make sure keycap orientation matches print_orientation.png. 
* keycaps should be placed on the chamfered face
* rotate keycap 45 degrees on the xy plane such that the typing surface is facing the front of the print bed

If you use orcaslicer, you can import the 3mf file and use that as a template. It contains all of the settings that worked for me.

Other slicers: see below
